# Day 15

A very efficient solution to the day 15 problem, returning solutions for both
parts in a few seconds.

The complexity of the solution to part I is O(S) where S is the count sensors.

The complexity of the solution to part II is O(NS) where S is the count sensors
and N is the line count.

See the documented code for more details.

## Usage

Part I:
```
./day15_1 [input] [line]
```

Part II:
```
./day15_2 [input] [max_coordinate]
```
